# Chutes and Ladders:
## Practicing Object-Oriented Programming

When I first started working with classes in Python I felt bombarded with terms like inheritance, polymorphism, base/ sub classes, and a myriad of syntax that looked about as familiar as Mandarin. To ease in to these concepts, one of my friends at the time suggested that I try to program a board game that I was familiar with. This is because Board Games have a lot of repetitive actions (turns), there are only a few objects (pieces, board, etc.) that you need to think about, and typically those individual pieces operate in a very small space. At the time I programmed chess (which took some time), but I figured that Chutes and Ladders would work just as well, and was able to get a working game in a couple hours when I was bored at work, so...

## The Goods

* Within the src directory I've included a not very pretty, but functional game of Chutes and Ladders.
* Within the practice subdirectory, I've mimicked the class/ file structure of the game I produced (minus the code)

##### To play the game:

* Open a terminal and navigate to the src directory
* Start an ipython session in your terminal (from the src directory) ($ ipython)
* Within IPython execute: run play.py
* This should start a command line prompt that will tell you everything that you need to do to continue playing the game

##### The Challenge:

* Read through the code that I wrote, and the skeleton provided.
  * Take notes/ chart it out if you need to wrap your head around it.
* Try to build as much as you can without directly copying code from the completed game
  * *Feel free to look at the code as much as you'd like in order to get started/ explore parts that are stumping you.*
  * *Also, keep the **\__str__** method within board.. that was super tedious to write*
* Get creative! Style matters more than you might think in programming

##### Caveats:

* I probably wrote this code in ~ 2 hrs and didn't really check my work.. so I expect that there will be mistakes
* I'm not sure that the board print formatting will look the same on Linux/macOs/Windows (or work)
  * If it doesn't: Try to just print out the positions of the pieces at the end of each round (this aspect is minor)


##### **Good Luck ! ! !**
